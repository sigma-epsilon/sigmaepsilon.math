This guide provides an overview of the mathematical concepts and theory underlying the library. 
It is intended as a reference for users who wish to understand the theoretical basis of the algorithms and 
techniques used here.

However, this is not meant to serve as a comprehensive treatment of optimization, linear algebra, or any 
other topic. Rather, it aims to introduce the fundamental ideas necessary for effective use of the library, 
ensuring that we share a consistent understanding of essential terms and concepts.

For example, different fields sometimes use words like "vector" or "tensor" in ways that differ from standard 
mathematical definitions. To clarify our usage, the next sections provide concise overviews of such key ideas as 
they are intended within this library.
