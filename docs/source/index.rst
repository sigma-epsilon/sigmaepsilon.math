The `sigmaepsilon.math`_ library is the mathematical department of the `SigmaEpsilon` project, a collection of 
Python libraries for computational mechanics and other disciplines. The library includes tools that emerged during 
work on other parts of the `SigmaEpsilon` ecosystem, but are general enough to be used in other projects.

Implementations are fast as they rely on the vector math capabilities of `NumPy`_, while other computationally 
sensitive calculations are JIT-compiled using `Numba`_. Here and there we also use `NetworkX`_, `SciPy`_, `SymPy`_ and `scikit-learn`_.
