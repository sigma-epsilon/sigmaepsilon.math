        """
        A subclass of `networkx.Graph`, extending its capabilities.
        See the documentation of `networkx` for the details on how to
        define graphs.

        Note
        ----
        If `networkx` is not installed, the class is `NoneType`, but the
        functionality it implements is still available, you just have to
        manage graph creation by yourself.

        Examples
        --------
        A basic example with `networkx`:

        >>> from sigmaepsilon.math.topology import Graph
        >>> import networkx as nx
        >>> grid = nx.grid_2d_graph(5, 5)  # 5x5 grid
        >>> G = Graph(grid)

        def adjacency_matrix(self, *args, to_csr: bool = False, **kwargs):
            """
            Returns the adjacency matrix of the graph.

            Parameters
            ----------
            to_csr : bool, Optional
                If `True`, the result of networkx.adjacency_matrix is
                returned as a csr_matrix.

            *args : Tuple, Optional
                Forwarded to networkx.adjacency_matrix

            **kwargs, dict, Optional
                Forwarded to networkx.adjacency_matrix

            Returns
            -------
            NumPy array, SciPy array or csr_matrix
                The adjacency representation of the graph.

            Examples
            --------
            >>> from sigmaepsilon.math.topology import Graph
            >>> G = Graph([(1, 1)])
            >>> A = G.adjacency_matrix()
